    Hey! I am Aditi Walia.
    This is my Mark1 exercise.

    A CLI quiz hosted on Node.Js to check how well do you know me.

    var readlineSync = require("readline-sync");

var score = 0;

var userName = readlineSync.question("What's your name? ");

console.log("Welcome " + userName)
console.log("Let's play a quiz how well do you know me?")

function play(question, answer) {
  var userAnswer = readlineSync.question(question);

  if (userAnswer === answer) {
    console.log("right!");
    score = score + 1;

  } else {
    console.log("wrong!");
    score = score - 1;
  }

  console.log("current score: ", score);
  console.log("-------------")

}

var questionone = {
  question: "Where do I live? ",
  answer: "Gurgaon"
}
var questiontwo = {
  question: "My favorite superhero would be? ",
  answer: "Krishna Ji"
}
var questionthree = {
  question: "Where do I work? ",
  answer: "Bharti Airtel"
}
var questionfour = {
  question: "What is my Hobby?",
  answer: "Painting"
}
var questionfive = {
  question: "What is my Favourite food?",
  answer: "Rajma rice"
}

var questions = [questionone, questiontwo, questionthree, questionfour, questionfive];
for (var i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) {
  var currentQuestion = questions[i];
  play(currentQuestion.question, currentQuestion.answer)
}


console.log("YAY! You SCORED: ", score);

var highScores = [
  {
    name: "Raghav",
    score: 5,
  },

  {
    name: "Deepa",
    score: 3,
  },
]

console.log("Check out the high scores, if you should be there ping me and I'll update it");

highScores.map(score => console.log(score.name, " : ", score.score))
